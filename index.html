            <h2>The mentality of "WHAT NEXT"</h2>

            <p>People say the best times of your life are your teenage years, you get to have fun, go to parties, make friends, and get wild, before adulthood and responsibilities and reality set in.</p>

            <p>But then really looking at it, are we living our best lives? </p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Are we doing what we want to do and not what society wants from us and has shifted our mentality on how to live?</p></li>
                <li><p> So many times, I sit and think and realize that the best moments of our lives have been our childhood days when we never really had to bother about anything.</p></li>
                <li><p> We only just LIVED, go to school to learn ABC, read and write a couple of words, and then weâ€™re back home playing football. </p></li>
            </ol>

            <p>While growing up</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p> We have tea parties with our dolls or watching tv, eating, sleeping, life was easy.</p></li>
                <li><p> But as time went on, we grew up, entered high school. </p></li>
                <li><p> Then the pressure started, the pressure to pass exams, the pressure to feel among. </p></li>
            </ul>

            <p> we get to a stage where any little mistake can ruin our entire life course <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/08/anxious-about-whats-next-heres-how-to-cope" target="_blank">helpful guide on mentality of what next</a></p>
